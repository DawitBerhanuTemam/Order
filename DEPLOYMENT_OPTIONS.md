# 🚀 Deployment Options for Your Food Ordering App

## Current Situation

Your app uses:
- ❌ MongoDB (not compatible with Firebase Hosting)
- ❌ NextAuth (needs to be replaced with Firebase Auth)
- ❌ API Routes (don't work with static export)
- ✅ Next.js frontend (works everywhere)

## Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (EASIEST - 5 minutes) ⭐

### Pros:
- ✅ **Zero code changes needed**
- ✅ **All features work immediately**
- ✅ **Free tier available**
- ✅ **Built specifically for Next.js**
- ✅ **Automatic deployments from Git**
- ✅ **Works with MongoDB, NextAuth, API routes**

### Steps:
```bash
# 1. Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# 2. Deploy
vercel

# 3. Follow prompts (takes 2 minutes)
```

### Result:
Your app will be live at `https://your-app.vercel.app` with everything working!
